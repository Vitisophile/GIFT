                    <p>Happyyy Birthdayyy! It's been a really long time knowing you and the way we came close I knew my curse would show up very soon and when it did I left GEC. But even with the curse we met and crossed paths unintentionally, that's why I always say how special you are to me.</p>

                    <p>The card's code was given by AI but I learned quite a lot just by seeing it and started altering it also the written part and ideas are fully by vrish. You may think I'm late which I am but I did wish you the exact moment you were born (8:30 IST as to what I remember) my main motive was to do something different which no one has done for you. The other thing why I don't write letters is because I wanna write so much but am not able to convey it properly then I start writing random thing which sometimes don't make sense but I still keep going on😅. There were few things which I wanted to know from your side, actually just one thing is enough for everything to be clear. </p>
                    <p>I've said many times how special you are, I guess it's time for you to tell me, What do you think of me? or What am I for you? let's do a fun thing I'll give you the tasks and you complete them according to your liking<br>1)0% : Ignore this letter like you're ignoring the reels I've sent 🥲<br>2)14% : Liked your message😐<br>3)28% : Text message🙂<br>4)42% : Reply with a letter for me😃<br>5)56% : Voice call🫶<br>6)70% : Facetime🤩<br>7)85% : Plan a meetup where we both intercept🥰<br>8)100% : Somehow you spawn right in front of me💗💗<br>Don't ask me what these percentages are cause even I don't know </p>
